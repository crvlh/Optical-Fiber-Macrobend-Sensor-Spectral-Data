This repository contains the data used in the article titled **Optical Fiber Macrobend Sensor Assisted by Artificial Intelligence for Monitoring a Flexible Structure**, which focuses on the development and testing of an optical fiber sensor based on helical geometry for deformation monitoring.

## File Overview

### `data.rar`
This compressed file contains the following data files:

1. **Spectrometer Data (`.txt` files):**
   - Contains the raw optical intensity data transmitted across various wavelengths.
   - Each file corresponds to a specific deformation configuration applied to the helical optical fiber sensor.

2. **Deformation Configurations (`.xlsx` file):**
   - Contains the deformation parameters associated with each sample, organized in sequential order.
   - Each configuration specifies the deformation applied to the monitored structure during the experiments.

## How to Use

1. Download the `.rar` file from this repository.
2. Extract the files using any decompression software.
3. Use the `.txt` files to analyze the transmitted optical intensities.
4. Cross-reference the `.xlsx` file to associate each spectrum with its corresponding deformation configuration.

## Purpose

These data are intended to:

1. Support reproducibility of the results presented in the article.
2. Provide a resource for further analysis of optical fiber sensors and deformation monitoring.
3. Enable validation of the proposed methodology in related studies.
